# Your Capstone Project

## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most
advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully
be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework and
tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything
you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little
outside of your comfort zone**.

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make
sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make
sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**. Sometimes people do
judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

## Technical Requirements

Your app must:

-   **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own
    front-end
-   **Have an API of your design**
-   Have user-owned data **should said data be owned by a user** (this may or
may not be the case depending on your application)
-   **Have an interactive front-end**, preferably using a modern front-end
    framework
-   **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships
    and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
-   **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you
    want to learn
-   **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help
    you know which features to build and which to scrap
-   **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and
    have something to wow future clients and employers
-   **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible
-   **Not** have any obvious user facing errors.

## Necessary Deliverables

-   **Planning Requirements** On the _first day_ of project worktime, you must
    commit:
    - A client README with user stories and wireframes
    - An api README with an ERD
-   **Daily Requirements**
    - You must have _at least_ one commit on _either_ your client or api repo for
    each day of project worktime.
-   A **working API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
-   A **working client app**, hosted somewhere on the internet that consumes
your API
-   A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
-   A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,
    and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
-   **Two ``README.md`` files** with:

    Client:
    -   An embedded screenshot of the app
    -   Explanations of the **technologies** used
    -   A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    -   **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    -   Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want,
        and why?
    -   Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in
        your application
    -   Link to your **pitch deck** – documentation of your wireframes, user
        stories, and proposed architecture
    -   Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had
        to overcome

    API:
    - Links to your client-side application, deployed client app, and deployed
      api.
    - An ERD
    - A list of your API routes
    - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used
    - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had
        to overcome

**IMPORTANT** If you do not meet the planning or daily requirements, you
**cannot** meet expectations for this project.
The final submission that you _must_ be the project you presented to the
cohort.

## Overall Score

Your consultants will give you a total score on your project as an aggregate
across all feedback categories:

| Score | Expectations                                           |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations._                          |
| **1** | _Meets expectations - good job!_                       |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations, you magnificent creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals.
But more important than your overall score is your feedback, particularly in
individual categories - this will help you identify where to focus your efforts
for future projects.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

-   **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always
    better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
-   **Design first.** Planning with user stories and wireframes before writing
    code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to
    build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
-   **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
-   **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use**.
-   **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
-   **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
    you can always go back in time to a previous version.
-   **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories
    focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
-   **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your
    naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at
    your app and understand what everything is?
-   **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find
    the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
-   **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each
    block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what and why means
    someone else can pick it up and get it.
-   **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the
    logic of something helps.

## Potential Project Ideas

### Q&A App

Think of how helpful sites like Quora and StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some
other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer
game.

### Car Repair Log

Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI
save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts and
important document you need to have backed up.

### Email-like Messages

Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread
messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we
know it.
